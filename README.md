DHLP-1 and DHLP-2

Scalable Label Propagation Algorithms for Heterogeneous Networks

The source codes for two scalable label propagation algorithms called DHLP-1 and DHLP-2 are provided.
The data must be in Apache Giraph input format. Here a sample data for both DHLP-1 and DHLP-2 is uploaded such that codes are provided based on them. In the codes, giraph.algorithms.minprop.App8 is DHLP-1 and giraph.algorithms.minprop.App9 is DHLP-2.

minprop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT is the jar file that must be execute.
